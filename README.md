Project: Creating Customer Segments


In this project, we will examine a dataset containing annual expenditure amounts from various customers across different product categories, reported in currency units. One of the objectives is to comprehensively characterize the differences faced by wholesale distributors in interacting with different types of customers. Through such analysis, distributors will gain a deeper understanding of how to optimally structure their delivery services to meet the unique needs of each customer. The dataset for this project can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. During the analysis, the features "Channel" and "Region" will be excluded, focusing specifically on customer records related to six product categories. It is important to note that this dataset is not intended for a classification or prediction task, as it lacks labeled fields. Instead, it is more suitable for feature analysis, feature selection, unsupervised learning, and recommendation systems. This project employs unsupervised learning methods to explore potential patterns within the dataset, aiding in the classification of different customer groups and facilitating the recommendation clustering for delivery services.
